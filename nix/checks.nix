# It declares its own inputs, so `default.nix` holds the package and does not
# carry arguments that only a test needs.

# `package` and `testSources` come from `default.nix`: the first because a

# the repository root is and this file does not.
#
# `nix/suite.nix` says why a check is two derivations.
